## Use case ##

Out-of-hours GP accesses medications, allergies and problems.

## Brief description ##

A patient calls the out-of-hours (OOH) GP complaining of pain and asking for painkillers.
The OOH GP wants to check:
-	what medications the patient is already taking
-	what they were prescribed for
-	when they were last issued, and how many
-	what allergies the patient may have
The GP has access to an electronic patient record system (EPR). The flow of information is from the GP practice clinical system to the OOH EPR. Data needs to be supplied using SNOMED CT codes.<br>
This use case will take place every time an OOH GP appointment takes place. The expected volume of this happening is to be determined.

## Use case justification ##

Without this information the OOH GP will have to make a judgement on whether it is safe to prescribe the medication the patient is asking for.
