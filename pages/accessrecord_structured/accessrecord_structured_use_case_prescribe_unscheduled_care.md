## Use case ##
**Patient to be prescribed medication in unscheduled care using active checking in an electronic prescribing environment.**

A patient presents at unscheduled care (urgent care, minor injuries, walk-in centre, mental health crisis team) and a clinician needs to prescribe medication for the patient. They have access to electronic prescribing and the Medicine Administration System (EPMA), which includes decision support (checks for allergies, adverse reactions and medical conditions). 

The flow of information will be from the GP practice clinical system into the EPMA. Information must be SNOMED coded for allergies, adverse reactions and conditions. Allergies and adverse reactions must include SNOMED coding for the allergen as a minimum. Conditions must be SNOMED coded.

These are required for active checking support in EPMA systems to cross-check against the contraindications from the drug file.
This is in an unscheduled care setting and, as such, data sharing agreements should not be required. This should only respect patient’s consent to share.

## Use case justification ##
In an unscheduled care setting, the patient may not be able to communicate in detail the details of allergies, adverse reactions or conditions that are relevant to prescribing. They may do so in a lay or generic terminology and this will not be clearly medically confirmed for the purposes of active checking of medication on prescribing.

As the patient’s GP is likely to have this information recorded, including the provenance and details of that information (for example, the type and severity of an allergic reaction and, if this is medically confirmed, reported by a clinician or just reported by the patient), automatically importing this information on registration at the unscheduled care location will ensure that this:
1)	Happens
2)	Is recorded accurately
3)	Does not require repeated querying of the patient for known data.

Discharge summaries supplied from unscheduled care settings are required to provide this information in a structured form (https://isd.hscic.gov.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/41/pack/34/subpack/240/releases).

## Primary actors ##

 - Clinician (doctor, nurse prescriber), EPMA

## Secondary actors ##

 -	Patient

## Triggers ##

 - clinician prescribes medication to the patient

## Preconditions ##

-	patient has been registered in attendance at the unscheduled care location and has gone through identification including retrieving their NHS number
-	the clinician is a qualified prescriber with access to create allergies, adverse reactions, conditions and prescribe medication within the EPMA system

## Postconditions ##

**On success**
-	allergies, adverse reactions and conditions are imported and recorded against the patient record in the EPMA

**Guaranteed**
-	the list of allergies, adverse reactions and conditions are recorded on the EPMA. Access is recorded for auditing purposes

| Step 3      |    EPMA requests list of current   allergies, adverse reactions and conditions from the patient’s registered GP.<br>Current   is defined as all allergies, adverse reactions and conditions that have been   recorded as being in effect at the current date, irrespective of when they   were added to the patient record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Step 5      |    GP practice clinical system checks   patient permissions and consent to share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Step 6      |    The EPMA receives the list   of allergies, adverse reactions and conditions for review. On confirmation   the clinician accepts the list as valid the information is imported into the   system.   The following information   is provided:<br>- Allergies<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Allergic   Substance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reaction   Type<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reaction<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Severity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Date   Added<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reported   By (clinician, patient)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Confirmed   by Clinician<br>- Adverse Reactions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Allergic   Substance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reaction   Type<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reaction   Severity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Date Added<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reported   By (clinician, patient)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Confirmed   by Clinician<br>- Conditions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- SNOMED   code for any diagnosed or long term condition    |
| Step 7      |    Drugs to be prescribed are   checked by the EPMA against the allergic substance and conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Step 8      |    Contraindications are   presented to the clinician within the context of the reaction type and   reaction severity as well as the reliability of the information for a   clinical decision. For example, a patient reported mild fatigue reaction to a   particular drug may be ignored as the effect of the medicine is more   important than this side effect for this patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 9      |    Clinician makes decision to   prescribe.
