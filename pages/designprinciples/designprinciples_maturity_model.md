{% include important.html content="The maturity model is currently under review and will be updated before the end of January 2018." %}

The maturity roadmap of a compliant principal GP system is expected to follow these FHIR&reg; and business capability maturity stages:

## Stage 1 - current ##
- Access Record (v1.0), Appointment (v1.0) and Task (v1.0) capabilities
 - Access Record includes: HTML Patient Summary, Encounters, Clinical Items, Problems and Issues, Allergies and Adverse Reactions, Medications, Referrals, Observations, Immunisations & Administrative Items
- Spine Security Proxy (SSP) integration
- Organisational Data Sharing Agreement checking in the SSP
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) auditing of local user roles in the JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
 
## Stage 2 ##
- Access Record (v2.0) with bundled structured resources
 - May include some improvements to HTML content such as:  HTML Warnings, Key Indicators, Current Recalls, Patient Details, Investigations, Medications Sections Improvements, Date-Range Improvements
 - HTML View Clinical Safety, Cross-Vendor Consistency Changes
 - Structured content for current Medications and Allergies (more resources to follow, see prioritisation list below)
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support in the SSP
- RBAC Auditing of Spine Smartcard user roles in the JWT

## Stage 3 ##
- Unbundled direct read-only access to specific resources (see prioritisation list below)


# Prioritised structured content #
This is the working list of structured resources required for Access Record v2.0 and Stage 3 RESTful access.

## Priority confirmed ##

1. a) MedicationOrder 
<br/> b) MedicationStatement
2. AllergyIntolerance
3. Immunization

9. MedicationDispense
10. MedicationAdministration
11. Observation
12. Problem
13. Procedure
14. Referral

{% include important.html content="It is expected that unbundled direct read-only access to resources will be undertaken in line with the high-level approach being pursued in other jurisdictions (for example, Project Argonaut and specifically the [Argonaut Implementation Guide](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Guide))." %}
