## Using an existing a FHIR library ##

GP Connect strongly advises suppliers to utilize an existing FHIR library as it will reduce development time and result in more robust implementations of the GP Connect API. Benefits of using an existing fhir library for the implementation of both the consumer and provider side of a GP Connect API are:

* ***Reduced complexity*** - Using a library can reduce the quantity of boiler plate code required to configuring provider endpoints, structuring a requests and validate consumed resources. This will help keep the code base smaller, easier to work on and maintain.
* ***Quicker development*** - A library gives developers the standard FHIR data types, FHIR resources and some validation of the FHIR resources, allowing developers to focus on data transformation and business rules.
* ***Solution resilience*** - Using a tried and tested implementation of the FHIR resources and data types should result in the implementation being more resilient to receiving valid but unexpected elements within FHIR resources. Many libraries will also include some level of validation to aid in ensuring that only valid data enters the system.


## What libraries to use? ##

There is an ever increasing list of open source FHIR libraries appearing on the web, written for a wide variety of languages (e.g. Java, C#.NET, JavaScript & PHP). As a starting point the Health Level Seven (HL7&reg;) International standards body maintains a list of open source FHIR implementations on their [Wiki](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_FHIR_implementations) page.

{% include tip.html content="It is a good idea to feedback into open source FHIR library projects to improve the implementations increase the maturity of the technologies for everyone's benefit." %}

In addition to open source FHIR libraries many widely used health software systems now support FHIR as a standard message type, which means some consumers and providers may be able to create a GP Connect interface with extensions available on their current system.
