---

## Use Case ##

The typical flow to book an appointment is:

 1. Search by `NHS Number` for, or otherwise obtain, a `Patient` resource.
 2. Search for available `Slot` resources by date range.
 3. Create an `Appointment` for the chosen `Slot` and `Patient` resources.

Refer to [Consumer sessions illustrated](appointments_consumer_sessions.html) for how this API Use Case could be used in the context of a typical consumer appointment management session.

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The Consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint Base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service.
- SHALL have previously obtained the details for one or more free slots that are to be booked.
- SHALL have previously performed a GP Connect `Find a Patient` request to obtain the logical identifier for the patient on the organisation's fhir server.

## API Usage ##

### Request Operation ###

#### FHIR Relative Request ####

```http
POST /Appointment
```

#### FHIR Absolute Request ####

```http
POST https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Appointment
```

#### Request Headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:create:appointment` |


#### Payload Request Body ####

The request payload is a profiled version of the standard FHIR [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/appointment.html) ![STU3](images/stu3.png) resource, see [FHIR Resources](/datalibraryappointment.html) page for more detail.

Consumer systems:
- SHALL send an `Appointment` resource that conform to the [GPConnect-Appointment-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-Appointment-1) ![STU3](images/stu3.png) profile.
- SHALL include the URI of the `GPConnect-Appointment-1` profile StructureDefinition in the `Appointment.meta.profile` element of the appointment resource.

The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present).
- a patient `participant` of the appointment.
- a location `participant` of the appointment, representing the physical location where the appointment is to take place (see [design decisions](foundations_design.html#location-in-the-appointment-resource) page).
- an `actor` reference in any supplied `participant`
- the `start` and `end` of the appointment.
- the `status` identifying the appointment as "booked".
- the `slot` details of one or more free slots to be booked.
- the `bookingOrganisation` extension referencing a `contained` `organization` resource within the appointment resource.
  - the contained organization resource SHALL represent the organization booking the appointment.
  - the contained organization resource SHALL conform to [CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1) ![STU3](images/stu3.png) profile.
  - the contained organization resource SHALL contain at least `Name` and `Telecom` details.
- the `created` element SHALL be populate with the date and time of the appointment was created.

The following data-elements SHOULD be included when available.
- a practitioner `participant` of the appointment.

{% include important.html content="Multiple adjacent free slots can be booked using the same appointment (i.e. two 15 minute slots to obtain one 30 minute consultation). Details on how providers will indicate that slots can be considered adjacent can be found in the [Payload Response Body](appointments_use_case_search_for_free_slots.html#payload-response-body) section of the [Search for free slots](appointments_use_case_search_for_free_slots.html) API Use Case page." %}

{% include note.html content="The provider system receiving the bookingOrganization details SHALL store, return and display these details as required by the [Must-Support](development_fhir_api_guidance.html#use-of-must-support-flag) flag." %}

The following guidance around Appointment Resource element should be followed when populating any of the listed fields:

| Resource Element        | Guidance |
| ---                     | --- |
| Appointment.***comment***     | This field should be used for "Patient specific notes" and any additional comments relating to the appointment. |
| Appointment.***description*** | This field should be populated with a "Summary Label", a brief description of the appointment as would be shown on a subject line in a meeting request, or appointment list. |

{% include note.html content="For providers who only support the mandatory `description` element and not the `comment` element, if a `comment` is received as part of the booking the provider SHOULD append the content of the comment to the description within the appointment so that the additional information is not lost." %}

{% include note.html content="If the consumer wishes to include ***patient temporary contact details*** for the purposes of the appointment they SHALL include them within the `description` element of the appointment, so that the details are retained against that specific appointment." %}

#### Example Request Body ####

On the wire a JSON serialised request would look something like the following:

```json
{
	"resourceType": "Appointment",
	"meta": {
		"profile": ["https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-Appointment-1"]
	},
	"contained": [{
		"resourceType": "Organization",
		"id": "1",
		"meta": {
			"profile": ["https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1"]
		},
		"name": "Test Organization Name",
		"telecom": [{
			"system": "phone",
			"value": "0300 303 5678"
		}]
	}],
	"extension": [{

		"valueReference": {
			"reference": "#1"
		}
	}],
	"status": "booked",
	"description": "Free text description.",
	"start": "2016-05-30T10:00:00+01:00",
	"end": "2016-05-30T10:25:00+01:00",
	"slot": [{
		"reference": "Slot/1",
		"display": "Slot 1"
	}],
	"created": "2017-10-09T13:48:41+01:00",
	"comment": "Free text comment.",
	"participant": [{
		"actor": {
			"reference": "Patient/1",
			"display": "Mr. Mike Smith"
		},
		"status": "accepted"
	},
	{
		"actor": {
			"reference": "Location/32",
			"display": "Leeds GP Clinic"
		},
		"status": "accepted"
	}]
}
```

#### Error Handling ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return an [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) ![STU3](images/stu3.png) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

For example:

- the submitted `start` and `end` date range does not match that of the requested `Slot(s)`.
- one or more of the requested `Slot` resources does not exist or already has a `status` of busy.

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

{% include important.html content="Provider systems MAY implement business rules to protect the responsible use of the booking API, in line with current business rules already in place to prevent misuse of appointment booking outside of the GPConnect API implementation." %}
