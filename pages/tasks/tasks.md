## Purpose ##

Demonstrates the ability to manage tasks across care settings and organisational boundaries by enabling health professionals to share information or request a task be performed in real time.

## Scenarios ##

- a user can send a notification which is for information purposes only
- a user can send a task requesting a user perform an activity
- a health professional at a patient's registered GP practice sends a task or notification to an extended access hub
- a health professional at an extended hub is able to identify the patientâ€™s own GP practice and can send a task or notification to that organisation
- users are presented with confirmation that a task is successfully delivered to the organisation or that it has failed in real time so they can retry or use an alternative channel
- users can make use of notifications and tasks across a range of care settings to demonstrate its applicability across care domains, such as 111, A&amp;E, Physio, Acute, Social, Community

Example clinical scenarios for FoT and beyond can be found on the [Tasks clinical scenarios](tasks_clinical_scenarios.html) page.
