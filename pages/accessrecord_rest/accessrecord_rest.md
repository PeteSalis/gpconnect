## Purpose ##

The aim of GP Connect Access Record Structured is to make a patient’s data held within GP Practice systems available to other parts of the NHS to support the direct care of that patient.

## Engagement ##

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support a wide range clinical uses, GP Connect has engaged with clinicians and other stakeholders to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support its use.

This engagement has included:

 - hospital consultants
 - hospital pharmacists and technicians
 - mental health nurses
 - mental health pharmacists and technicians
 - mental health point of access centre
 - general practitioners
 - community pharmacists
 - midwives
 - health visitors
 - health system suppliers
 - commissioning support units
 - hospital trusts
 
The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business use cases, user stories and a logical data model available below. These will form the basis of the technical specification and will be used to assure that the GP Connect API meet the needs of the business.
