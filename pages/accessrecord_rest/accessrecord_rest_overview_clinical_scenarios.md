## Clinical scenarios ##

1. A health professional is able to view and import allergies into their local patient record system.
2. Information is rendered natively in a system rather than embedded in a HTML view to provide a more seamless experience, e.g. mobile device.
3. Information offered in a structured and coded form by the API for the purposes of reconciling medications, problems and allergies e.g. as part of an inpatient spell.
