## Patient Dissent to Share Flag ##

When Foundations APIs are used to support the Appointment Management Capability, the above flag SHALL NOT be applied by Provider systems.

## PDS S-Flagged Patients ##

If, in response to the Find or Read a Patient API, the Provider system determines that a patient has a PDS 'S-Flag', then the Patient's location and contact details are to be replaced by those of the target GP Practice.
